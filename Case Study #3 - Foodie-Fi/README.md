## **Key learning points**
* Deal with "slowly changing dimension" (SDC) table using ranking function (`ROW_NUMBER`/`RANK`/`DENSE_RANK`)
  > A Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) is **a dimension that stores and manages both current and historical data over time in a data warehouse**
* When dealing with `DATE` data type, to calculate the difference between them, there are 2 possible approach:
	*  `DATE_1 - DATE_2` will return the difference of days in `INTEGER`
	*  `DATE_PART('day',AGE(DATE_1 - DATE_2))`
        * `AGE` will return an `interval` data type
        * `DATE PART` will extract our desired part from this `interval`
