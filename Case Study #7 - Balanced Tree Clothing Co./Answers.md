# üëë A. High Level Sales Analysis

### 1.  What was the total quantity sold for all products?
````sql
SELECT
  t2.product_name,
  SUM(t1.qty) AS total_qty
FROM
  balanced_tree.sales t1
  INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details t2 ON t1.prod_id = t2.product_id
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY

### 2.  What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
````sql
SELECT
  SUM(qty * price) AS total_rev
FROM
  balanced_tree.sales
````
**Answer**
| total_rev | 
|--|
| 1289453 | 

### 3.  What was the total discount amount for all products?
````sql
SELECT
  ROUND(SUM(qty * price * discount :: NUMERIC / 100), 2) AS total_discount_amount
FROM
  balanced_tree.sales
````
**Answer**
| total_discount_amount| 
|--|
| 156229.14| 

‚ùó **Note**
* Remember to cast column into `NUMERIC` type before division, or you would get an integer floor division result instead (E.x., a result of 0.5 would be returned as 0)
# üí± B. Transaction Analysis
‚ùó **Note**
* As `balanced_tree.sales` table contains product-level information for all transactions, we must remember to 
	* Account for unique transaction_id using `DISTINCT txn_id`  
	* Or aggregate data for unique transactions using `GROUP BY  txn_id` before performing any further calculations
### 1.  How many unique transactions were there?
````sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)
FROM
  balanced_tree.sales
````
**Answer**
| count| 
|--|
| 2500|

### 2.  What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
````sql
WITH cte AS(
  SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS frequency
  FROM
    balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY
    txn_id
)
SELECT

**Answer**
| avg_unique_product_per_transaction|

| 7|
### 3.  What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?
````sql

‚ùó **Note**
* Differentiate between
	* `NTILE()`
		> Divide an ordered data set into a number of buckets indicated by expr and assigns the appropriate bucket number to each row
	* `PERCENTILE_DISC()`
		> Return the percentile value as a number from the distribution
	* `PERCENTILE_CONT()`
		> Not guarantee to return one of the value in the distribution. Instead, this functions interpolates the percentile. This might not be accepted in business practice, so use `PERCENTILE_DISC()` instead in such cases
### 4.  What is the average discount value per transaction?
````sql
WITH cte AS(

‚ùó **Note**
* Once the `GROUP BY` clause is executed, individual records can not longer be accessed. Thus, another aggregation `SUM` function must be put into the window function `SUM` to calculate the total sum as follows:
	* The inner `SUM` will be executed after the `GROUP BY` clause
	* Then, the outer `SUM` will sum up the results from the inner `SUM`
