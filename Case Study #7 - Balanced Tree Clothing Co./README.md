## **Key learning points**
* Differentiate between
    > `NTILE()`
    > 
    >Divide an ordered data set into a number of buckets indicated by expr and assigns the appropriate bucket number to each row

    >`PERCENTILE_DISC()`
    >
    >Return the percentile value as a number from the distribution

    >`PERCENTILE_CONT()`
    >
    > Not guarantee to return one of the value in the distribution. Instead, this functions interpolates the percentile. This might not be accepted in business practice, so use PERCENTILE_DISC() instead in such cases
